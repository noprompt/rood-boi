"""Does a change alter the game? The same fight on two builds, frame by frame.

    python3 pc/tools/build_compare.py OLD_BINARY [NEW_BINARY] [--card CARD] [--seconds 30]

Every step the named fields of every actor (RPC battle_state: its record, stats, object and AI state) are
compared too, which shows what an off-screen actor does. Afterwards every enemy is defeated (its HP written to 0) and the loot the game builds
is compared too: how many drop nodes, each one's actor id and item bytes.

Runs are deterministic (no wall clock in game logic, no input), so two builds of
the same behaviour draw the same frames. A room with enemies is entered from the
save room checkpoint and left to play: the enemies walk, attack and cast. Every
quarter second the frame's hash is taken and, at the end, what was cast. NEW_BINARY
defaults to this tree's build. OLD against OLD runs first as the control: if that
differs, the comparison proves nothing and the tool says so. Exit 0 when the frames
match, and the sound: the room's recorded mix (this room, then zone 15 room 0 with its script) must be byte for byte the same
(--audio off skips it; on a mismatch the first differing time is printed). Covers this fight and this sound only, not every screen or effect.

    python3 pc/tools/build_compare.py OLD_BINARY --casts [spells,arts] [--cast-limit N]

The wider lane: instead of the fight, Ashley casts every spell of the four schools (and
the equipped category's Break Arts) through the menus, as tests/charge_skip_soak.py does,
and the display is hashed every few vsyncs through each action. Old, old again (the
control) and new are compared action by action. Where the new build records them
(RPC effect_sites), the effect polygon call sites that ran are mapped to plugin
functions and counted against all of the build's (the coverage the frames cover).
Slow (several minutes); its actions are the spells' effect plugins, not every one.

    python3 pc/tools/build_compare.py OLD_BINARY --menus [ending,menuf] [--vram-stream] [--menu-sample N] [--claims off] [--aspect 16:9] [--new-env K=V]

The menus' lane: the screens the classic UI draws, reached by the routes classic_parity.py tours them by (the
save room's game, the classic look: the shipped plugins on, so rood.classic's claims draw what they claim;
--claims off leaves the game's own drawing), with the display hashed every N vsyncs (default 10) through
everything each route does. Old, old again (the control) and new are compared route by route. The routes are
SCENES below: a new screen's route is one function there, or one of classic_parity.py's tours wrapped as the others are. Routes:
mainmenu, manual, levelled, buff (the HUD buff rows), emote_arrow (the off-screen emote arrow and the balloons), items, magic, arts, abilities, status, score, map, data (MENU7's SAVE and LOAD file menus), setup, loot,
storage, ending, menuf, dialogue (the talk bubble's every shape: first_bubble), title (its menu and its file menu's copy) and gameover
(MENU7's game over LOAD). opening_events (the opening played through, the scanlines forced on) and script_<zone>_<room> (a room's own event script, for the rooms with a door into them) and platforms (the platform shadows of rooms 9-5, 15-7, 24-2, 25-2, 32-0) and story_<scene id> (a story scene of pc/assets/cutscenes/story.json played as the cutscene player plays it, from the title: the rooms and events no warp reaches; the wipes, the screen effect, its border).
