/* Native equivalent of hand-written BATTLE/BATTLE.PRG/5A624.s func_800C2E24:
 * the area Map screen renderer called by func_800C4794. Not a matching
 * decompilation claim; it reproduces the original memory effects literally.
 *
 * Scratchpad work space (all left behind as the original leaves it):
 *   0x1F800088  9x9 cell heights for the current view rotation (+3 pad bytes)
 *   0x1F8000DC  per-scanline span counts (224 rows)
 *   0x1F8001BC  180 cell-edge flags, then their row bytes at +0xB4; later
 *               reused for triangle span rows and the 32-point view circle
 * the battle menu block (D_800EB9B8_t.spans) holds 224 rows of 32 x-coordinates (span pairs). The
 * spans are built from the projected cell outlines, cut by lowered walls and
 * marker triangles (+0x4AB8), clipped to the circle's left edge, then emitted
 * as semi-transparent LINE_F2 packets along the circle's right edge. */
