/* The draw walk's commands to the hardware renderer (T1 plan R1, pc/docs/plans/2026-11-12-t1-renderer-thread.md).
 *
 * The walk (boot_runtime.c, boot_polygons.inc, boot_lines.inc, ui_bubbles.c) is the producer: it appends a record for each
 * renderer call that carries its whole description and needs no answer, instead of calling the hook. The renderer is the
 * consumer: it applies the records, in order, by calling the hooks (gpu_hw.c), at the first of
 *   - any other hook of the renderer (every pc_hw_* hook begins with PC_HWC_SYNC through PC_HW_METER),
 *   - the end of a walk (pc_draw_packet, pc_draw_item_packet),
 *   - a full buffer.
 * Today the consumer runs inline on the game thread, so the split is invisible: the renderer sees the same calls in the same
 * order with the same arguments (pointer arguments are copied into the record). When the consumer becomes a thread the
 * buffer is what it reads.
 *
 * The records so far: the primitive state setters (pc_hw_set_2d, _narrowed, _room, _precise, _depth, _packet, _flipped_uv,
 * _bounds) the draw calls without an answer (_rect, _line) and the walk's native-list marks (pc_hw_anchor_packet, _native_marker, _native_translucent, _ot_native_area). */
