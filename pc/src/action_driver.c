/* The action driver (dev RPC `action`): starts action N through the game's own entries, so the effect runs as in play.
 *
 * A player's action (a spell, a break art, an item) goes in by the entry the menus' target confirmation calls
 * (pc_action_start_player). What the menus leave in the battle state D_800F19CC when they call it is the action index (+8), the
 * targets they built and a few menu words; nothing else differs between two actions of the same kind. So the state is captured as
 * menu-driven actions call the entry (`capture`) and replayed with another action index: one state per kind, the action's type and
 * its shape of target (pc_action_kind); only a choice the entry takes (not a pending one it drops) is captured, and a break art is
 * replayed only for its own weapon category (its effect reads the weapon). The states are the host's (dev_rpc.c: they outlive a rewind
 * of the game's state, and `save` / `load` keep them in a file). An action of a kind never captured is refused.
 *
 * An actor's action (the base attack, an enemy's ability the actor commands run from its own list) goes in by
 * pc_action_start_actor with no captured state: {id, actor}. Other actions have their own entries: the chain and defence abilities
 * (type 2) are resolved as hits from the chain input, traps (type 7) by the room's panels, type 0 has no effect. */
